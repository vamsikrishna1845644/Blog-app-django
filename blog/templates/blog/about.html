        <h1 class="mb-4">About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hey there! I'm a B.Tech student at NIT Jamshedpur School, passionate about technology, data science, and building meaningful digital experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started this blog to share what I learnâ€”from Python and Django to data analysis, machine learning, and beyond. As someone who believes in learning by doing, this space reflects my journey, projects, and everything in between.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm currently exploring Django for web development and sharpening my DSA skills for placements. I believe in writing clean code, thinking deeply, and growing one step at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m probably overthinking something or quietly observing the world. ðŸ˜Š
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks for stopping by. Stick around if you're curious about tech, data, or the life of a quietly driven student navigating the path to becoming a data scientist.
        </p>
